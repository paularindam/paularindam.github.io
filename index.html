	<p>Since graduating with my PhD in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2019, I have been working as a Machine Learning Scientist at American Family Insurance. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. </p>

  <p> During my PhD, I worked at <a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/">CUCIS</a> group on applications of machine and deep learning for accelerating scientific discovery in the fields of cheminformatics, materials informatics  and manufacturing technology. </p>

  <p> I also completed my M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2014. During my M.S., I have worked
   on internet privacy at the <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Networks Group</a> led by Prof. Kuzmanovic,
    and studied anonymity in social media  at the <a href="http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Social Media Lab</a> directed by Prof. Birnholtz. </p>

  <p>Prior to that, I completed my M.Eng. in Software Systems and B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India. </p>
