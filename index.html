  <h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
  <p class="intro">My friends call me a lifelong learner. One reason maybe becauseâ€¦.  </p>
	<p>I am currently a doctoral candidate in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University. I have a B.E. (Bachelor of Engineering) in Chemical Engineering and M.Eng. in Software Systems from BITS Pilani, India and a M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University. Hopefully by 2018, I would be having 4 degrees in 4 different disciplines.</p>
  <p>Also, I am very curious about knowing the world, and have an eclectic taste. </p>
  <p>I also love reading about psychology and philosophy.
    Although not a social scientist, the complexity of the mind have always interested me.
    Although it might sound cliched, I had dreamt of being a researcher or a scientist since I was 6 years old.
    So I am grateful to all the teachers and mentors and my friends in my life for where I am. I remember reading about quantum and nuclear physics in my middle school.
     I feel proud to be born in the land of Aryabhatta, Ramanujan and Bose.</p>
  <p>During my time at Northwestern, I have worked in different labs before finally finding my passion.
    I have worked on internet privacy in the Networks Lab led by Prof. Kuzmanovic,
    and social media at the Northwestern Social Media Lab (SML) directed by Prof. Birnholtz.</p>
  <p>Right now, I am working at the CUCIS lab led by Prof. Alok Choudhary. I am working on materials informatics and materials data analytics.</p>
  <p> My current hobbies are writing and public speaking. I am the Treasurer of the Northwestern Toastmasters Club. I am also the President of the Northwestern Cricket Club.</p>
  <p>I am a Segal Design Institute Fellow, and received the Segal Fellowship at the beginning of my 3rd year of graduate school. The fellowship is for promising students I am currently finishing up completing a paper on my work during that time.</p>
  <p> I had been fortunate to be supported by my parents and my sister who have always encouraged me to study, even when our family were in financial crisis.</p>
  <p>Teaching is one of my passions. I enjoy spending time with my students while TAing and whenever I take a course, I imagine how I would like to teach the same course. I do see myself as a professor 10 yrs down the line. But, I would like to work in industrial research for a while. Right now, their is a lot of pioneering research in Machine Learning happening in industry. Google DeepMind, FAIR, IBM Watson, MSR are currently what Bell Labs were in the 1960s.</p>
  <p>I have often felt that the academic environment often disadvantages grad students especially internationals. And, one of my future goals is to become a spokesmen for the grad students when I would have the power to influence the academic system.</p>
