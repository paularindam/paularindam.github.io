	<p>I am a PhD Candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Northwestern University, and I am expected to graduated in December 2018.  My research falls under the areas of machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and, data mining in social and scientific applications. My research interests also span materials informatics, cheminformatics and health informatics. I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2014. Prior to my time at Northwestern, I completed a bachelor's and masters degree in Chemical Engineering and Software Systems from <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India. </p>


  <p>Before finding my purpose at my current lab, I have worked
   on internet privacy at the <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Networks Group</a> led by Prof. Kuzmanovic,
    and studied anonymity in social media  at the <a href="http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Social Media Lab</a> directed by Prof. Birnholtz. </p>
