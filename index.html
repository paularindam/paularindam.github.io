  <!-- <h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1> -->
<div class="home" id="home" align="justify">
  <p class="intro">My friends call me a lifelong learner. One reason maybe becauseâ€¦.  </p>
	<p>I am currently a doctoral candidate in Computer Engineering at Northwestern University. I have a B.E. (Bachelor of Engineering) in Chemical Engineering and M.Eng. in Software Systems from <a href="http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a>, India and a M.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University. Hopefully by 2018, I would be having four different degrees, all in separate disciplines.</p>
  <p><font color="purple"><b><i>My research is at the intersection of Machine Learning and Computational Materials Science. I study materials data and try to build intelligent systems to accelerate materials discovery. Right now, I am also using Deep Learning techniques as I am handling more volumnious and unstructured data. </i></b></font></p>
  <p>I am working at the <a href="http://cucis.ece.northwestern.edu/">CUCIS lab</a> led by <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~choudhar/">Prof. Alok Choudhary</a>. I am also co-advised by <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~ankitag/">Prof. Ankit Agrawal</a>. My projects are part of the <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/">Materials Genome Initiative</a> of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/mgi">US Government</a>. </p>
  <!-- <p>I received the <a href="https://segal.northwestern.edu">Segal Design Fellowship</a> at the beginning of my 3rd year of graduate school. The fellowship is for promising students I am currently finishing up completing a paper on my work during that time.</p> -->
  <p>Before finding my purpose at my current lab, I have worked
   on internet privacy at the <a href="http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Networks Group</a> led by Prof. Kuzmanovic,
    and studied anonymity in social media  at the <a href="http://socialmedia.northwestern.edu">Northwestern Social Media Lab</a> directed by Prof. Birnholtz.</p>
  <p>Teaching is one of my passions. I enjoy spending time with my students while TAing and whenever I take a course, I imagine how I would like to teach the same course.
    Although, I see myself as a professor 5-10 yrs down the line, I would like to work in industrial research for a while. Every graduate researcher get to know their strengths during grad school.
    I see mine as being innovative, curious and having a problem solving attitude.</p>
    <p>Right now, their is a lot of pioneering research in Machine Learning happening in industry. Google DeepMind, FAIR, IBM Watson, MSR are currently what Bell Labs was in the 1960s.
    <a href ="http://wp.goertzel.org/">Ben Goertzel</a> is my idol. He is the reason I have become excited about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7c89EepVOI">Artifical General Intelligence</a>. Read his latest <a href="http://wp.goertzel.org/deep-mind-and-go-and-hybrid-ai-architectures/">blog</a>.
  I closely follow the work and videos of Deep Learning pioneers like <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/">Geoff Hinton</a>, <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/yoshua_en/index.html">Yoshua Bengio</a>, <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Yann LeCunn</a>,
  <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Zhoubin Ghahramani</a> to name a few.</p>
