	<p>I love reading. Recently, I have become hooked onto reading books on psychology and philosophy. Although not a social scientist, the complexity of the human mind and society have always interested me. Right now, I am reading Elon Musk's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk:_Tesla,_SpaceX,_and_the_Quest_for_a_Fantastic_Future"> biography</a> and Eric Schmidt's <a href="http://www.howgoogleworks.net/">How Google Works</a>.</p>

		<p> My other hobby is creative writing. Although, primarily I write short stories and poems, my goal is to write a novel this year. One day, I would like to have my work published. Meanwhile, you can follow my <a href="http://arndmpaul.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.I also enjoy public speaking. I had extreme stage fright and I had started my voyage of public speaking by going to a <a href="https://www.northwesterntoastmasters.com">Northwestern Toastmasters </a>open house. Since then, I have fallen in love with public speaking and Toastmasters. I love speaking with passion and listening to wonderful moving stories. </p>

		<p> I am enthusiastic about science communication and an avid Quoran. I love answering questions on Quora and feel more fulfilled as an academic. I think I learn more and go deeper in the topic when I have to respond to an answer requested to me. Follow <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Arindam-Paul-3">me.</a> Of late, I have also become active in answering questions on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arindam_Paul5?ev=hdr_xprf&_sg=JzGC3flVg1hIGUgH2jBKbJaW250mw5YmFsGbrJZ1xbrJEBsmrkj94lqNa0IVtRbq">ResearchGate</a>.</p>

		<p>And I love animals especially the little ones. Whenever life gets boring or hard or I am down, I watch adorable baby animals. My favorite are kitten videos. </p>
