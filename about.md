	<p>I love reading. Recently, I have become hooked onto reading books on psychology and philosophy. Although not a social scientist, the complexity of the human mind and society have always interested me. Also, I am a fan of Elon Musk and right now, I am reading his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk:_Tesla,_SpaceX,_and_the_Quest_for_a_Fantastic_Future">biography.</a></p>

    <!-- <p>Although it might sound cliched, I had dreamt of being a scientist since I was 6 years old.
    My favorite subjects at school were Math and Science. It was a simple curiosity to know about the world, and I am grateful to my mentors to keeping that curiosity alive. I feel proud to be born in the land of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata">Aryabhatta</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGm9Vlfx4w">Ramanujan</a> and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Satyendra_Nath_Bose">Bose</a>.</p> -->

		<p> My other hobby is creative writing. I am an ardent writer and a regular member of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Evanston-Creative-Writing-Group/">Evanston Creative Writing Group</a>. Although, primarily I write short stories and poems, my goal is to write a novel this year. One day, I would like to have my work published. Meanwhile, you can follow my <a href="http://arndmpaul.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.I also enjoy public speaking. I had extreme stage fright and I had started my voyage of public speaking by going to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/886190904789415/">Northwestern Toastmasters </a>open house. Since then, I have fallen in love with public speaking and Toastmasters. I love speaking with passion and listening to wonderful moving stories. Since last Fall, I am also the Treasurer of the club. The picture at the top is from me speaking at an outdoor Toastmasters event during last summer.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about social justice. I also volunteer at a non profit <a href ="http://www.braveinitiatives.com/">Brave Initiatives</a> where we teach and encourage high school girls to code. I am also supporting a girl child's education in India through <a href="https://www.children.org/">Children international</a>. The pics of her and her village in India. Go fund a child !!</p>

	  <p> Apart from that, I am trying to learn Spanish and how to dance Tango. I also follow cricket thanks to my best friend and roommate Divya who is an ardent follower. I am  also the President of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/114037852056065/">Northwestern Cricket Club</a>.</p>
		<p> I am enthusiastic about science communication and an avid Quoran. I love answering questions on Quora and feel more fulfilled as an academic. Follow <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Arindam-Paul-3">me.</a> Of late, I have also become active in answering questions on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arindam_Paul5?ev=hdr_xprf&_sg=JzGC3flVg1hIGUgH2jBKbJaW250mw5YmFsGbrJZ1xbrJEBsmrkj94lqNa0IVtRbq">ResearchGate</a>.</p>

		<p>And I love animals especially babies. Whenever grad school gets hard or I am down, I watch adorable baby animals. My favorite are kitten videos. </p>
