	The problem is related to a general optimization setting: a forward model is at hand that
	produces y from any input pattern x, and the purpose is to find x that optimize y. While the
	forward model is non-differentiable and parameters non-learnable, we turn it into a neural
	model, which once fixed, can be transferred to have the patten x learned.
